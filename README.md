# OHM-Android-Application
The main goal of this app is to provide a mobile application system for patients to interact with doctors and other staffs from nearby local hospitals in order to prevent time delays while billing and scheduling appointments. The application helps in overcoming the requirement of having files and pages for prescription and report. Currently, different departments in the healthcare center have their own separated systems leading to the lack of communications and the inefficient data sharing. Through this application, doctors from different hospitals can retrieve, update, and report information about their patients efficiently and greatly improve the data sharing and communication.  There would be two different user modules for this app which are the Doctors and Patients. Patients will be able to check doctor’s availability and book the appointment. Doctors will be able to accept and reject appointments. Doctor’s prescription will be stored and viewable to all departments. Lab test results will be updated in the Android application and be visible for both users.Total medical expenses including consulting and surgical billing will be calculated and displayed in the app to the user.
